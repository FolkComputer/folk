1. Computer
    1. For portable installations a [Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) or an [Orange Pi 5](http://www.orangepi.org/html/hardWare/computerAndMicrocontrollers/details/Orange-Pi-5.html) 
        1. Note: for these options you’ll also need an SD card for the OS, SD card reader, & power supply (often sold separately)
    2. Our studio uses an Intel *Hades Canyon* NUC
2. Projector
    1. We recommend the [AAXA 4K1](https://aaxatech.com/store/products/4k1_pico_projector_store.htm) ($1000) for the brightest, clearest text rendering
    2. If you’re on a budget or want a more portable option the [AAXA P400](https://aaxatech.com/store/products/P400_mini_projector_store.html) ($269) is a good option for a portable 1080P projector
    3. Any projector will do, but any projector with a native resolution of less than 1080P will only be good for projecting shapes & very large text
3. Camera
    1. Any 720p or 1080P webcam will do
4. Printer
    1. Any printer will do, if you’re looking for a small printer for your setup we use the [Epson EC C-110](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Inkjet/WorkForce-EC-C110-Wireless-Mobile-Color-Printer/p/C11CH25202) ($339)
5. Mounting hardware
    1. For a portable installation either [a microphone boom arm](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1540295-REG/samson_samba48_microphone_boom_arm_stand.html/?ap=y&gclid=CjwKCAjww-CGBhALEiwAQzWxOu-g3UOeonw8y3RgrKOl32IqRmzAJFhwXUg-gp0JuU0uuLkcWnVc7RoCdGgQAvD_BwE&lsft=BI%3A514&smp=y) or a [selfie stick tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Bluehorn-Portable-Aluminum-Wireless-Shutter/dp/B07K7MSV25/ref=sr_1_8?crid=1IFNZYSFOSDUI&keywords=selfie+stick+tripod&qid=1677347914&sprefix=selfie+stick+tripod%2Caps%2C102&sr=8-8) (”selfie stick” rather than traditional extending tripod because it takes up less room on the desk) for the projector. Additionally use a [flexible mini tripod](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1359603-REG/joby_jb01507_gorillapod_3k_kit.html) or a [clip with a 1/4” attachment](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1695995-REG/zuma_z_amc_1032a_clamp_with_5_8_stud.html) to mount the camera on the base of the boom arm/tripod.
    2. For large installations where you can’t screw in a projector into the ceiling we recommend getting a C-stand ([like this for example](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/850444-REG/Impact_ls_ct40mbk_Turtle_Base_C_Stand_Kit.html)) to attach your projector onto.

TODO: Clarify cables, mounting hardware weight limits, & min-heights for camera & projector.
