When /someone/ wishes /thing/ is outlined /color/ &\
     /thing/ has resolved geometry /geom/ {
    dict with geom {
        set points [list [list 0 0] \
                        [list $width 0] \
                        [list $width $height] \
                        [list 0 $height] \
                        [list 0 0]]
    }

    Wish to draw a line onto $thing with \
        points $points width 0.01 color $color
}
