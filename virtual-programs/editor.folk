Wish $this has filename "editor.folk"

Commit cursor { Claim the program [list 0 0]}
Commit { Claim the program is [list] }


Every time the keyboard character log is /k/ & the program is /p/ {
  Commit { Claim the program is [list {*}$p [lindex $k end]] }
}

When the program is /p/ {
  Wish $this is labelled $p
}
