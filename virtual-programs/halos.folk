When /someone/ wishes /page/ has fuzzy halo with radius /radius/ color /color/ \
  & /page/ has region /r/ {
  ## Kick off shader that takes
  set pageBounds [region vertices $r]
  # pageBounds and creates a fuzzy SDF halo around all the pages! :)
  Wish $page is titled "this will be a fuzzy halo ... just you wait!"
  Wish $this is outlined thick teal
}

Wish $this has fuzzy halo with radius 5 color teal

# Eventually `outline` should actually just be undergirded by:
# Wish $this
