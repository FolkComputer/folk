When /someone/ wishes /p/ runs Unix command /c/ {
	set jobid [incr ::nextunixjobid]
	dict set ::unixjobs $jobid [dict create object $p command $c log [list]]

	lassign [chan pipe] reader writer
	set pid [exec {*}$c >@$writer 2>@1 &]
	close $writer

	fconfigure $reader -blocking 0
	fileevent $reader readable [list ::readline $jobid $reader]

	When /p/ is running Unix command /c/ with job id $jobid output /log/ {
		Wish $p is labelled [join $log "\n"]
