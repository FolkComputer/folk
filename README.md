to run on (Mac) laptop:
```
$ brew install tcl-tk
```

then (on laptop or Pi):
```
make
```

## setup notes
- get a separate computer (Raspberry Pi 4, probably). don't use your laptop.
- make as solid / permanent a mount as you can. you shouldn't be
  scared of it falling and you shouldn't have to take it apart and put
  it back together every time

## stuff
- implement generators (point at)
- implement even-better fake lexical scope
- ~share (axiom) statements from laptop -> Pi~
- ~mmap or otherwise hw-accelerate pi graphics~
- bareword/nicer colors for Pi
- keyboard support for Pi
- watchdog on Pi, autoupdate on Pi
