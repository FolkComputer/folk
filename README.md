# folk

to run on (Mac) laptop:
```
$ brew install tcl-tk
```


```
$ /usr/local/Cellar/tcl-tk/8.6*/bin/tclsh folk.tcl
```
or (on M1)
```
$ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/tcl-tk/8.6*/bin/tclsh folk.tcl
```

## setup notes
- get a separate computer (Raspberry Pi 4, probably). don't use your laptop.
- make as solid / permanent a mount as you can. you shouldn't be
  scared of it falling and you shouldn't have to take it apart and put
  it back together every time
