This directory contains examples of Jim interpreter API. In order to start
working with Jim API one may just want to copy existing example .c file
into new file, modify Makefile and start working on a new program.

Existing examples
=================

jim_command
	Simple command implementation in Jim's API. Command is then executed
	in a script encoded within a program.

jim_hello
	Standard "Hello world!" program, from executing a script.

jim_list
	Will teach you how to create a list in Jim's API.  Once created,
	will show how to name and export it, so that variable is visible in
	the script's source code. Once done, interpretation of separate
	print.tcl file is presented. As a result, the script can print a
	list members created from within ANSI C program.

jim_obj
	Basic object creation in Jim.

jim_return
	Similar to jim_command example, but implemented command actually
	returns a value.
